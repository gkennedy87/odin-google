Challenge: Recreate Google Homepage with HTML and CSS

Things I learned:
- Learned how to create the avatar image from scratch. Previously had always used Bootstrap's.

- How to utilize Flexbox AND Grid together. Grid for the overall layout, and flexbox on elements and rows.

- Learned how to create the unique Google burger menu for their app sidebar. Had to play around with a few options but settled on using 9 `<hr>` elements nested in a div with margins and padding. It's not a perfect replica but pretty good for just eyeballing it. Google actually uses an img or svg for theirs.

Final thoughts:
This was a pretty fun project. I challenged myself to make it as accurate as possible without using any frameworks or Google resources. I only used their color palette for the Google logo.

While this project is not overly difficult, I did get to sharpen my CSS skills a bit more. Learning how to make the avatar images will be undoubtably very useful.
